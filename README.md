# Simulation-Engines-for-Maintenance-Events-in-Heterogeneous-Machines

Recent studies in reliability increasingly rely on data-driven algorithms, such as machine/deep learning, which require large amounts of failure and maintenance data for training and validation. However, such historical data are often scarce in industrial practice, limiting the development and evaluation of these methods. To address this limitation, this study develops two feature-dependent simulation engines that generate realistic degradation and maintenance datasets under both time-based (TBM) and condition-based maintenance (CBM) frameworks.

The TBM engine simulates maintenance event logs for industrial equipment over predefined observation periods. Failures are modeled as a non-homogeneous Poisson process with competing failure types, while machine-specific features are incorporated through a proportional hazards structure to capture their influence on failure behavior. The model also considers the impact of imperfect preventive maintenance on subsequent failure occurrences. For each unit, the simulation generates a sequence of preventive and corrective maintenance events, including their timing, type, and associated costs.

The CBM engine focuses on degradation-path simulation. It generates stochastic degradation processes—including Gamma, Wiener, and compound Poisson models—and captures machine heterogeneity and feature-driven effects through static and dynamic covariates. Observed degradation indicators are generated by introducing measurement noise to latent degradation levels, and preventive maintenance is scheduled according to the specified maintenance policy. Maintenance costs are modeled using a transparent, type-specific framework, enabling analysis of cost structures for different maintenance actions. The engine produces degradation paths and maintenance event logs for multiple units.

Together, these engines provide a flexible environment that facilitates data-driven decision-making in maintenance planning, service provision, and lifecycle cost management.
